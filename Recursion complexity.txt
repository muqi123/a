recursion:
1. time complexity 
2. space complexity, usually logn, recursion use tmp memory, and release it immediately, so usually does not consume extra space

quick sort( partition data, inline move data, ramdon select a pivot, so time complexity is not garnered ):
time complexity: best: nlogn, worst: n^2, average: nlogn
space complexity: O(n)

merge sort( partition data, need to copy data, always select the middle one to do the partition )
time complexity: always nlogn
space complexity: O(n)

DP:

Time complexity: number of subProblem * complexity of each subproblem
Space complexity: what need to memorize
